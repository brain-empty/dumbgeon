# dumbgeon
a simple console based game i made to study c++

# download
to download the game itself without the rest of the files; https://github.com/brain-empty/dumbgeon/raw/2a5b040df8e5c85a4277d304a81b214f70ee9f8c/main.exe

# flaws
- there was supposed to be a flee function while fighting but i couldn't implement it so there's a lot of stray code because of it
- the difficulty scaling might be all over the place
- minor visual issues because of how hard it was to code this 

# credits
i didn't make the ASCII art myself, it comes from this website: https://ascii-generator.site/t/
